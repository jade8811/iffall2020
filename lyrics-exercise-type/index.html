                Hold on, I thought that I could take it from here<br>
                Oh, I thought that I was calm in the clear<br>
                Now it's getting harder<br>
                Hold on, I thought that I was doing so well<br>
                Oh, like everything was under a spell<br>
                Now it's getting harder<br>
                <div class="chorus">
                I never loved you fully in the way I could <br>
                I fought the current running just the way you would <br>
                And now I'm in the creek <br>
                And it's getting harder <br>
                I'm like fallingwater <br>            
                </div>
                <br>
                Go on and tell me just what I'm supposed to say <br>
                As if it could be any other way <br>
                Oh, it's getting louder<br> 
                Go on and tell me just how I could allow <br>
                All that's light to end up somehow <br>
                Where it's getting darker <br> 
                <br>
                <div class="chorus">
                I never loved you fully in the way I could <br>
                I fought the current running just the way you would <br>
                And now I'm stuck upstream <br>
                And it's getting harder <br>
                I'm like fallingwater <br>
                </div>
                <br>
                Fallingwater <br>
                Fallingwater<br>
                <br>
                And I'm like fallingwater, set me free<br>
                You were like fallingwater coming down on me<br>
                <br>
                <div class="chorus">
                I never loved you fully in the way I could<br>
                I fought the current running just the way you would<br>
                And now I'm in the creek<br> <br>
                </div>
                I never gave you everything, I wish I could<br>
                I should have seen it coming from the way you stood<br>
                But now I'm in the creek<br>
                And it's getting harder<br>
                And it was coming down on me<br>
                And I was standing in the creek<br>
                You were like falling water<br>
                I was like falling water in the creek
