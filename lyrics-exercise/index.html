            Hold on <br>
            I thought that I could take it from here<br>
            Oh I thought that I was calm in the clear<br>
            Now it's getting harder<br>
            Hold on<br>
            I thought that I was doing so well<br>
            Oh like everything was under a spell<br>
            Now it's getting harder<br>
            <br>
            I never loved you fully in the way I could <br>
            I fought the current running just the way you would <br>
            And now I'm in the creek <br>
            And it's getting harder <br>
            I'm like fallingwater <br>            
            <br>
            Go on <br>
            And tell me just what I'm supposed to say <br>
            As if it could be any other way <br>
            Oh it's getting louder<br> 
            Go on <br>
            And tell me just how I could allow <br>
            All that's light to end up somehow <br>
            Where it's getting darker <br>
            <br>
            I never loved you fully in the way I could <br>
            I fought the current running just the way you would <br>
            And now I'm stuck upstream <br>
            And it's getting harder <br>
            I'm like fallingwater <br>
            <br>
            Fallingwater <br>
            Fallingwater<br>
            <br>
            And I'm like fallingwater<br>
            Set me free<br>
            You were like fallingwater<br>
            Coming down on me<br>
            <br>
            I never loved you fully in the way I could<br>
            I fought the current running just the way you would<br>
            And now I'm in the creek<br>
            I never gave you everything I wish I could<br>
            I should have seen it coming from the way you stood<br>
            But now I'm in the creek<br>
            And it's getting harder <br>        
            <br>
            And it was coming down on me <br>
            When I was standing in the creek <br>
            I'm like fallingwater <br>
